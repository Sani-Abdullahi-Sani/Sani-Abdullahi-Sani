# Hi, I'm Sani Abdullahi Sani 👋

I aspire to integrate insights from human perception and cognition into AI design, I aim to contribute to cutting-edge research in cognitive science through the development of innovative technologies that enhance learning, memory, and decision-making. By incorporating cognitive models, I strive to predict behavior and optimize human interaction with technology. Additionally, I am deeply interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in working with low-resource African languages. My goal is to curate data and create meaningful models that address unique African challenges. I am also fascinated by reinforcement learning techniques and applications, which I believe hold great potential in creating adaptive and intelligent systems.

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Languages:** Python, C++
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn
- **Tools:** Git, GCP, Latex, Robot Operating System (ROS), Jupyter
- **Other:** Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Robotics

## 🔥 Projects
### [Reconnaisance Blind Chess]([Reconnaissance Blind Chess (RBC)](https://github.com/Sani-Abdullahi-Sani/Artificial-Intelligence-Projects/tree/84741cbd0b5a9d6f07778ac8dfab24dfada85c98/Reconnaissance%20Blind%20Chess%20(RBC))
We Implemented a baseline agent with random sensing and made to play a round-robin tournament with Random Bot and the Trout Bot. The
RandomSensing agent used is an advanced iteration, whereby only the minimum amount of potential states are stored. We later improved the Agent by improving sensing, better move generation and better openings.

### [Brain Tumor Project](https://github.com/yourusername/ai-research)
We applied deep learning techniques to the detection and classification of brain tumors using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans.

### [SurveillanceBot using a TurtleBot](https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-insights)
We developed a SurveillanceBot using a TurtleBot to explore, map, and navigate within a given environment. The primary tasks included mapping the environment, navigating to specified coordinates, and detecting a green utility cart.
